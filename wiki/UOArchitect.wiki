#summary v2.6.6mod-K.

= UO:Architect v2.6.6mod-K =

This is mine modified version of the popular UO:Architect.
Focus was on the interface and ease of using, not on server.

I'm sorry but i will not provide support for this program because i don't have any uo installation left.

This program IS NOT TESTED with HS expansion (it was created before.. :) )
