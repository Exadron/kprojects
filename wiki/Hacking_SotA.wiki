#summary Or how i made a local server for Shroud of the Avatar.

Shroud of the Avatar should be the next generation Ultima Online.
So i thought to my self: "Does it support Customized Servers?"

The answer is: obviously yes.

The game is still in pre-alpha, so a lot will change before it will be made playable, but the core won't probably change.

I started digging by looking through the game files.
SotA is being developed using Unity, so C#.. 
How convenient ;) (RunUO anybody?).

Attached you can see screenshots of my first login on local server.

Please notice my code does not use any DB (yet?), so the code is static and just written to reach logged state.
